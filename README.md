# symmie
Friendly symbol notation.

The goal of this project is to provide a systematic notation for technical
symbols and emoji. The notation consist of a name plus a number of
order-independent modifiers that are separated by colons.

_This project is still in an early phase. More documentation will follow later._

## Examples
Below are a few examples of symmie notation:

| Notation        | Symbol |
|-----------------|--------|
| `pi`            |   π    |
| `arrow:r`       |   →    |
| `arrow:l`       |   ←    |
| `arrow:tr:hook` |   ⤤    |
| `sub:eq`        |   ⊆    |
| `turtle`        |   🐢   |
| `face:grin`     |   😀   |
| `woman:old`     |   👵   |
